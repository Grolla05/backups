Without You 

[Verse 1]
The walls, they whisper my name,  
But their words bring no relief.  
I wander streets that feel so hollow,  
Searching for what’s left of me.  

[Chorus]
And the wind carries your shadow,  
Like a cry that cuts through the night.  
Without you, I’m just a stranger,  
A soul that’s lost its guiding light.  
The city mourns in silent echoes,  
And I’m a heart left broken inside.  


[Verse 2]
Each note I play on this guitar  
Bleeds the weight of you not here.  
I paint memories on the ceiling,  
Hoping they’ll fade, but they appear.  


[Chorus]  
And the wind carries your shadow,  
Like a cry that cuts through the night.  
Without you, I’m just a stranger,  
A soul that’s lost its guiding light.  
The city mourns in silent echoes,  
And I’m a heart left broken inside.  

[Solo]

**[Chorus]**  
And the wind carries your shadow,  
Like a cry that cuts through the night.  
Without you, I’m just a stranger,  
A soul that’s lost its guiding light.  
The city mourns in silent echoes,  
And I’m a heart left broken inside.  


**[Outro]**  
The walls, they whisper my name,  
But their words bring no relief.  
I’m just an echo lost in the distance,  
A fragment of us falling beneath.
