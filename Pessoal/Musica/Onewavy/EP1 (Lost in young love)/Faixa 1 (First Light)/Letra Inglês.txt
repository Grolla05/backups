First Light 

Verso 1 
I saw you standing in the summer glow,  
A fleeting moment, but it felt so slow.  
Your eyes lit up, a spark ignites the night,  
A tangled mess of nerves, it felt so right.  

Pré-refrão  
Every glance, a fire burned inside,  
The world just stopped, and the stars aligned.  
A reckless heartbeat, a leap of faith,  
Caught in your orbit, I can’t escape.  

Refrão  
Underneath the first light, we collided,  
Lost in the haze where love decided.  
The air was thick with dreams untold,  
Two young souls in a world so bold.  

Verso 2  
A jukebox hum, a quiet café scene,  
Sharing secrets, chasing restless dreams.  
Your laughter lingered, painted the air,  
Like a melody only we could share.  

Pré-refrão  
The city blurred, but your face stayed clear,  
A fleeting love that erased the fear.  
Under streetlights, we danced with fate,  
Caught in the moment, it was too late.  

Refrão  
Underneath the first light, we collided,  
Lost in the haze where love decided.  
The air was thick with dreams untold,  
Two young souls in a world so bold.  

Ponte  
But time stood still, as the world turned fast,  
Every heartbeat wishing this would last.  
Falling deeper into your embrace,  
The universe folding into this space.  

Refrão Final  
Underneath the first light, we collided,  
Lost in the haze where love decided.  
The air was thick with dreams untold,  
Two young souls in a world so bold.  

Encerramento (Coda)  
And if I could, I’d relive that night,  
The way your smile caught the fading light.  
A story started with no end in sight,  
Forever lost in that first light.
