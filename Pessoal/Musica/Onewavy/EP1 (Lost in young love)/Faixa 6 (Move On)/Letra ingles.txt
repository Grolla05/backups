Move On

(Verse 1)
Through laughter and memories, I see,
A love that was real but no longer for me.
The days have passed, time had its say,
What once was pain, the wind swept away.
And if life calls, I’ll answer the sound,
What’s left behind won’t hold me down.
With every step, I feel so free,
I move on from what time took from me.

(Chorus)
Move on, like the waves to the shore,
Move on, I’m not holding on anymore.
It was love, it was true, but now it’s gone,
Now I dance to the tune of what’s moving on.

(Verse 2)
No weight in the memories I hold,
Just lessons from the paths I’ve strolled.
Love builds us up, even when it departs,
And every ending’s a brand-new start.
And if life calls, I’ll answer the sound,
What’s left behind won’t hold me down.
With every step, I feel so free,
I move on from what time took from me.

(Chorus)
Move on, like the waves to the shore,
Move on, I’m not holding on anymore.
It was love, it was true, but now it’s gone,
Now I dance to the tune of what’s moving on.

(Bridge)
I run, I scream, I feel alive,
What once was pain has turned to light.
No need to look back, I see it clear,
The present’s the place where life draws near.

(Final Chorus)
Move on, like the waves to the shore,
Move on, it’s time to celebrate more.
It was love, it was true, but now it’s gone,
Now I dance to the tune of what’s moving on.

(Outro)
The past is a dream that I’ve left behind,
The future’s a road where I’ll always find,
I move on, but I won’t forget,
What brought me here, I’ll never regret.
